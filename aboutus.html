          <hr>
          <p>We are the national organisation representing all hospice services in New Zealand, we don’t have a “head office” role as all of our hospice members are independently governed and managed at a local level.  We work in partnership with all member services to ensure people needing end of life hospice care are well supported. </p>
 
                   <p>Heart of Gold connects nonprofits, donors, and companies in nearly every country in the world. We help fellow nonprofits access the funding, tools, training, and support they need to serve their communities.</p>

            We provide our directory listings free of charge to foodbanks across New Zealand. Whilst we are not a registered charity thanks to your support we have purchased and delivered over 75 tonnes of food to local foodbanks and have distributed over $150000 in donations to organisations across the country. If you would like to support us by covering our operating costs you are welcome to make a donation of any amount using our contact page.</p>
 
                   <p>As an essential health service, hospices receive the majority of funding from Government, but financial support from the community is essential to meet the shortfall – more than $77 million nationally every year.

                    There are two ways your donation can support hospice – locally, by choosing the hospice in your community, or nationally, by supporting Heart of Gold.</p>
